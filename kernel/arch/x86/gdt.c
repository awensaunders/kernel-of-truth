/* The Global Descriptor Table and its entries.
 * x86 uses a backward, antiquated segmented memory model for compatibility
 * with computers which were around in the late Cretaceous. The Global
 * Descriptor Table, or <gdt>, can control whether or not certain sections of
 * memory can run with elevated privileges (ring 0), as well as whether they
 * are used for code or data. Additionally, one 'gate', or entry in the GDT
 * called the Task Struct Segment or TSS, can be used to set up hardware
 * multitasking. We follow the example of professional OSs like Linux as well
 * as hobbyist systems like ToaruOS and do our best to ignore both the GDT and
 * hardware multitasking as much as possible. Better mechanisms exist for
 * enforcing access control, such as paging. Additionally, I read that properly
 * implemented software multitasking is faster than hardware multitasking
 * anyway. Nonetheless, we must placate the Gods of x86 and create a GDT and a
 * TSS.
 *
 * Our GDT will have 6 entries:
 *
 * 1. An empty entry because the manual says so.
 * 2. A kernel mode code segment.
 * 3. A kernel mode data segment.
 * 4. A user mode code segment (not yet created).
 * 5. A user mode data segment (not yet created).
 * 6. A TSS entry (not yet created).
 *
 * This structure represents a single entry in the <gdt>. See figure 3-8,
 * Chapter 3, Volume 3 of the Intel Manual and the rest of the chapter for more
 * information.
